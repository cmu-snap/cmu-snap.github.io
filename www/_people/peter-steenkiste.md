Peter Steenkiste is a Professor of Computer Science and of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He received the degree of
Electrical Engineer from the University of Gent in Belgium in 1982, and the MS
and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1983 and
1987, respectively. His current research is in the areas of future Internet
architecture and wireless networking.

Peter Steenkiste's research interests are in the areas of networking and
distributed computing. While at CMU, Peter Steenkiste worked on Nectar, the
first workstation clusters built around a high-performance, switch-based local
area network. He contributed both to the optimization of the communication
subsystem and to the development of programming tools for workstation clusters.
The optimization of application-level communication performance over commodity
networks was further explored in the Gigabit Nectar and Credit Net projects.
All these projects developed prototype systems that were used by a wide range
of application groups, allowing a realistic evaluation of the research.

Peter Steenkiste's current research is in the areas of wireless networking and
future Internet architecture. The wireless landscape has changed dramatically
in recent years. Not only have we seen a rapid growth in the use of wireless,
but we are also seeing different types of deployments (e.g. unplanned and
managed residential deployments in addition to traditional campus-style
deployments) and more diversity in the technologies (e.g. Bluetooth, sensors,
..). Peter Steenkiste is involved in wireless projects in a number of areas,
including self-management techniques for residential networks, emulation as a
basis for evaluating wireless technologies, and the use of software radios as a
platform for flexible, self-optimizing wireless protocols.   In the area of
future Internet architecture, Peter Steenkiste heads the eXpressive Internet
Architecture (XIA) project. The eXpressive Internet Architecture defines a
single network that offers inherent support for communication between multiple
communicating principals - including hosts, content, and services - while
accommodating unknown future entities. XIA also offers intrinsic security in
which the integrity and authenticity of communication is guaranteed. XIA is
currently exploring a wide range of topics, including security, transport
protocols, network diagnostics, services, management, etc.

Peter Steenkiste is a member of the ACM and a Fellow of the IEEE. He has been
on many program committees and he was co-chair for the OPENSIG'99 workshop and
the "Eight International Workshop on Quality of Service (IWQOS'00)". He was
also program chair for HPDC'2000 and general co-chair for ACM SIGCOMM'02. More
recently, he was program co-chair for MobiCom 2008. He has been an associated
editor for IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (1998-1999),
IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (2000-2003), and Cluster Computing
(2000-2004), and the "Journal of Grid Computing".
