I am a second-year PhD student in CMU’s Computer Science Department, co-advised
by Professor Justine Sherry and Professor Srinivasan Seshan.

I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Amherst
where I worked with Professor Charles Weems in the Architecture and Language
Implementation Group. I earned my B.S. in Computer Science from The State
University of New York at New Paltz. Prior to CMU, I was Associate Technical
Staff at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in the Cyber Analytics and Decision Systems
Group.

I am a two-time recipient of the National GEM Consortium Fellowship and was
named one of SUNY New Paltz’s 40 under Forty Alumni in 2017.
